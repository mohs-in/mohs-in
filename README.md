# Hey there, I'm Mohsin! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at Capgemini, based in Gurugram.

What started as a love for frontend development has grown into something bigger. These days, I find myself diving deep into core engineering concepts â€” you know how it is, one thing leads to another, and suddenly you're down a rabbit hole reading about distributed systems at 2 AM.

I'm big on learning and sharing knowledge. That's why I'm building this [Personal Wiki](https://kb-mohsin.vercel.app/) where I document everything I pick up along the way. It's my way of giving back and honestly, helping future me remember stuff I learned six months ago.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading or writing about tech. Always curious, always learning.
